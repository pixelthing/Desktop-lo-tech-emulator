# Lo tech desktop background emulator

A desktop background picture that gives outlines of the screensize (and rough viewport size if you remove the OS chrome) of a bunch of popular devices.

This isn't a substitute for testing on real devices - or even IDE environments like Chrome emulator (although be aware that gives you screen size - not browser viewport size - by default), but is meant as a super quick way of testing responsiveness during your dev process.
