# Lo tech desktop background emulator

A desktop background picture that gives outlines of the screensize (and rough viewport size if you remove the OS chrome) of a bunch of popular devices.

This isn't a substitute for testing on real devices - or even IDE environments like Chrome emulator (although be aware that gives you screen size - not browser viewport size - by default), but is meant as a super quick way of testing responsiveness during your dev process.

Currently in the res of my screens - 1920x1200 and 1280x800. The Fireworks file (.fw.png) is the src file for both (in different pages).

The background to the background is a tiled pattern I found on a free pattern site - apologies and thanks to the author, whoever you are!
